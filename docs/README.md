# Jumpstart:Docs

* The general documentation in [Foundations](/foundations) will act as the
track for the Jumpstart event as we collaborate on your Application.
* Temporal SDK distinctions for this language that should be highlighted are found in the [SDK](/sdk) directory.
* The [Onboardings](/onboardings) documentation describes the specific steps taken
to implement the reference `onboardings` Application we will reference to describe
scenarios and see how they fit together.
