# Jumpstart:Foundations

The following modules will describe the foundations for the decisions we make as drive out the Application.
We employ "top down", Test-Driven Development to drive the Application features.
The following modules will always appear in the following order:

1. [Starters](Starters.md)
2. [Workflows](Workflows.md)
3. [Activities](Activities.md)
4. [Tests](Tests.md)
5. [Versions](Versions.md)
6. [Workers](Workers.md)

The Application requirements will determine the order and depth into which the following modules _might_ appear. 

* [Timers](Timers.md)
* [Writes](Writes.md)
* [Reads](Reads.md)

The following modules are supplementary and will provide a basis for operational Application concerns.

* [DataConverter](DataConverter.md)
